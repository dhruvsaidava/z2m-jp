## Global Impact: Where Z2M Has Been Used

### 🇲🇾 **Malaysia (Kedah State)**
Over **60 students** from ten rural schools joined a 3-day bootcamp. They built inventions, formed teams, and presented their ideas. Each school received a **Zero2Maker Maker Lab in a Box** that could serve 50 students at a time. Students practiced their design skills and taught other students in their schools to build an ecosystem over time.

### 🇮🇳 **India**
Workshops in **Atal Tinkering Labs** helped 7th-grade girls learn electronics and design, boosting confidence and creativity. The program was also implemented in **seven rural schools** from farming villages in South India, similar to the Malaysia model.

### 🇯🇵 **Japan (Fukuoka University)**
College students were trained to **mentor young school makers**, creating a cycle of community learning and peer-to-peer education.
